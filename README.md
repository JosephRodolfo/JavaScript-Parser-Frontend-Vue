# Javascript-Parser-Frontend-Vue

This is a frontend built with Vue for a JavaScript parser and eventually possibly runtime I wrote in Rust. Originally I wrote this using React but to learn Vue for an upcoming internship I'm rewriting and completing it using Vue3 and TypeScript. 

Features will include, and did up to the point I stopped in the React version, a simple custom code editor, a tab system to save and switch between different examples, and a slider to set the width of the parsed code display.
